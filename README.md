# Machine Learning Practice
This repository contains the code and notes from my machine learning practice sessions guided by Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The course covers various fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and practical advice on applying machine learning to real-world problems.
