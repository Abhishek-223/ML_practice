# Apple-Orange Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning classifier to distinguish between apples and oranges based on surface texture. The classifier uses features extracted from the surface texture (bumpy or smooth) to make predictions. The project is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```




## Results
The classifier's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics provided in the classification report. Ensure to analyze these results to understand how well the model distinguishes between apples and oranges.
